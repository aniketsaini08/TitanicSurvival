# Titanic Survival Prediction
Predicting survival during the Titanic disaster is a classic machine learning challenge. This project leverages historical passenger data to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger would have survived based on specific features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. The solution is built with a strong focus on:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model evaluation

# Features of the Project
# 1. Data Analysis and Visualization
Detailed exploration of passenger demographics and survival statistics.

Visualizations for a better understanding of survival trends.

# 2. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values and outliers effectively.

Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

# 3. Feature Engineering
Creation of insightful features like family size and passenger titles.

Use of domain knowledge to enhance the dataset.

# 4. Model Development
Training multiple machine learning models.

Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimized performance.

# 5. Evaluation and Validation
Comparison of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization of performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

# Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).

Sex: Gender of the passenger.

Age: Age of the passenger.

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.

Fare: Ticket fare paid by the passenger.

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Note: The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from Kaggle.

# Key Insights
Who Survived?
Higher survival rates observed among women and children.

Passengers in 1st class had a significantly higher chance of survival compared to those in 2nd and 3rd classes.

# Most Influential Features
Gender (Sex) and ticket class (Pclass) emerged as the most critical predictors of survival.

# Results
The project achieved the following results:

Accuracy: XX%

Precision: XX%

Recall: XX%

F1-Score: XX%

These metrics validate the reliability and robustness of the survival prediction model.

# Future Improvements
Experiment with advanced machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks.

Enhance feature engineering by incorporating additional data sources or domain-specific insights.
